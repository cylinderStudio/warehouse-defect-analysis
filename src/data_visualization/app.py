This interactive dashboard explores the correlation between environmental conditions — specifically **temperature** and **noise** — and order fulfillment defects in a warehouse packing area.

The data powering this analysis is **fully synthetic**, designed to mimic real-world warehouse operations and conditions across a four-month period (June–September 2024). It includes a pre/post intervention split simulating the introduction of fans, portable AC units, and noise-dampening curtains in August.

Use the selector in the sidebar to explore visualizations of:
- Defect rate by **temperature** and **noise level**
- Overall defect rate before and after intervention
- Heatmaps showing joint effects of temperature and noise across time periods
