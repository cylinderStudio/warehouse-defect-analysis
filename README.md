# Warehouse Defect Analysis – Proof of Concept

This project simulates and analyzes the correlation between environmental conditions (temperature and noise) and defect rates in a warehouse fulfillment process. The goal is to demonstrate how real-time sensor data combined with operational data can be used to identify and validate environmental stressors contributing to order fulfillment errors.

---

## Project Overview

This project showcases an end-to-end data engineering workflow:
- Environmental data simulated via CircuitPython for an RP2040 Connect microcontroller.
- Fulfillment and sensor data posted to Supabase via REST API.
- Analysis performed in Python using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
- Visualized in an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

Although real hardware and ingestion code were developed, all data was ultimately simulated to construct a full proof-of-concept.

## Supabase Schema

### Table: `order_fulfillment_data`

| Column           | Type          |
|------------------|---------------|
| id               | int4 (PK)     |
| timestamp        | timestamp     |
| ship_date        | timestamp     |
| defect_reported  | defect enum   |
| pack_date        | timestamp     |
| order_id         | text          |
| number_of_items  | int4          |
| ship_method      | carriers enum |
| box_size         | box_size enum |

### Table: `shipdock_environmental_data`

| Column       | Type    |
|--------------|---------|
| id           | int4 (PK) |
| timestamp    | timestamp |
| temperature  | float8    |
| noise_level  | float8    |

### Enumerated Types
- `box_size`: A, B, C
- `carriers`: usps, fedex, ups, dhl
- `defect`: missing items, wrong items, poorly packed

---

## Data Modeling

- `defect_reported_bool`: boolean flag for analysis
- `mitigation_period`: labeled "pre" (June–July) or "post" (August–September)
- `temp_range`, `noise_level_range`: binned ranges for grouped visualization

---

## Visualizations

- **Bar Charts**
  - Defect rate by `temp_range` (`grouped_temp`)
  - Defect rate by `noise_level_range` (`grouped_noise`)
  - Defect rate by `mitigation_period` (`grouped_all_defects`)
- **Heatmaps**
  - Pivot tables showing `defect_reported` ratio by `temp_range` and `noise_level_range`
  - Pre- and post-mitigation views with consistent scale

---

## Correlation Analysis

The merged dataframe shows weak but visible positive correlation between:
- Higher temperatures and higher defect rates
- Elevated noise levels and defect reports

---

## Results

- Functional simulation of environmental + operational data
- Interactive dashboard to view patterns over time
- Modular pipeline that mirrors real-world industrial analytics

---

## Next Steps

- Test with real IoT sensor data
- Expand schema to track packing employees or shift schedules
- Integrate dashboard into real-time operations UI
